I would like to build a card game. the game I would like to impliment would be the game of war. this game would entale many aspects of the basic game and possibly some extra parts in order to fill out the project fully. The game will consist of 1-2 players allowing you to play against the computer or against another player. 
    This game will allow many specialized parts first it will come from a home made API detailing all of the cards. next
it will inculed a table to involve the winner board and this board will be stored in local storage so as not to be lost. and it will allow game play through drag and drop.
I chose this specific game because I thought it would give me a chance to do all of the things we learned in class this semester. I believe that with this project I will be able encompass every requirment needed. Finally one of the most important reasons why I chose this project is that I believe it will be fun.
